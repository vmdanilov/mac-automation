# Mac Automation

A set of Automator workflows to solve interesting problems on macOS.

## Workflows

- **Make Transparent Copy** – create a transparent copy of image file by making the first pixel slightly transparent, if not already. This way you can share pixel-perfect uncompressed images on social media like Twitter.

- **Paste as Plain Text** – paste unformatted text from clipboard where *Paste and Match Style* may not be available. It is recommended to assign the same shortcut as *Paste and Match Style* and *Paste and Match Formatting*.

You can run file workflows from the selection context menu in Finder.

## Installation

1. [Download ZIP](https://github.com/vmdanilov/mac-automation/archive/master.zip) and unpack the archive.
2. Double click an Automator workflow to install.

The workflows will be installed to `~/Library/Services` and available through *Main Menu > **Application** > Services* or context menu on selection, if applicable. You can assign shortcuts to workflows in *System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services*.
